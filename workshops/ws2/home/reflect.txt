* the reason for the significant time difference between the copy and move operations
For this workshop we worked with the chronus library to time how long it took to count the number of records in a file and also to copy these records to other instances of the same class. The at home part allowed for a time comparison between using copy constructor and assignment operator, and move constructor and move assignment operator. Move constructors and move assignments are faster because they are a way of moving resources from one instance to another, instead of making a copy, which is a more complex operation. When a copy is made, you end up with two instances having the same information; when a move assignment is used, on the other hand, the information from one instance is moved to another without having to deallocate and allocate resources unnecessarily.
