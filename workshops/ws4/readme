# Workshop 4: Containers

In this workshop, I coded three classes that are in composition and aggregation relations. 
The classes simulate a very simplified form of managing reservations in a restaurant. 
The restaurant manages a collection of reservations (composition); a messaging system will be used to send confirmations for the reservation.

## Learning Outcomes

- design and code composition and aggregation class relationships
- use the member functions of the string class to parse a string into tokens based on simple rules
- design and code a class that manages a dynamically allocated array of pointers to objects

## *Lab*

The in-lab portion of this workshop consists of modules:
- `w4` (supplied)
- `Reservation`

### `w4` Module (supplied)

### `Reservation` Module

This module defines a class that holds information about a single reservation at a restaurant for a date/time in October.

### Sample Output

When the program is started with the command (the file `data.txt` is provided):
```
w4.exe data.txt
```
the output should look like:
```
Command Line:
--------------------------
  1: w4.exe
  2: data.txt

## *Home*

Includes two more modules:
- `Restaurant`
- `ConfirmationSender`

### `Restaurant` Module

 This module maintains a dynamically allocated array of objects of type `Reservation`: `Reservation*` (each element of the array is an object of type `Reservation`).
 
 ### `ConfirmationSender` Module
 
 The purpose of this module is to receive all the reservations from multiple restaurants, and contact the recipients with a confirmation message.

This module maintains a dynamically allocated array of **pointers** to objects of type `Reservation`: `const sdds::Reservation**` (each element of the array is a pointer to an object of type `Reservation`).

### Sample Output

When the program is started with the command:
```
w4.exe data.txt
```
the output should look like:
```
Command Line:
