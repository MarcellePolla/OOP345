# Workshop 1: Across Translation Units

In this workshop, I implement aspects of linkage, storage duration, namespaces, guards, and operating system interfaces.

## Learning Outcomes

- declare a local variable that remains in memory for the lifetime of the program
- guard a class definition from repetition
- access a variable defined in a different translation unit
- receive program arguments from the command line
- upgrade code to accept and manage a user-defined string of any length
